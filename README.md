### Hi there 👋

I'm OZ-DevONE!

![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,cpp,js&perline=3)

- 🔭 I’m currently diving deep into the world of programming, crafting innovative solutions one line of code at a time.
- 🌱 My skillset includes:
  - **Python** [7/10]
  - **C++** [3/10]
  - **JavaScript** [5/10]
- 👯 I specialize in creating Telegram bots and various types of parsers. Additionally, I design desktop applications.
- 🛠️ The tools and libraries I frequently employ for my projects include `aiogram` for asynchronous telegram bots, `requests` for making HTTP requests, `selenium` for web automation, `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) for web scraping, and `qt` for GUI applications among others.
- 🤖 Though I don't often delve into it, I also have experience in crafting Discord bots.
- 💼 Freelancing is my jam! Check out my profile on [profi.ru](https://profi.ru/profile/ZaynutdinovRR3/).
